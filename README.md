# Stickies app with Vue.js

## About the app

- The project is made with Vue.js (version 2). This is my absoulte first time touching and working with Vue and the environment is very new to me.
- I did not use 3 Vue.js, because I had problems using npm package bootstrap-vue. (But it is possible to use the regular bootstrap and its classes)
- For the styling I used SCSS.
- For saving data and their position of sticky notes I used localstorage, which is updated each time any value of note changes.

## How it works

- You can add a new note with "Add note" button. It will create a note with default text.
- You can delete all notes with "Delete all notes".
- Sticky notes icon with number on the right shows, how many notes currently have been made.
- To change the note title and note body text, click either on the title or the note body to change the corresponding text.
- To change the color of the note, click the paint brush icon, which will cycle through the colors!
